# Employee-Retention
## Short Description 
A ML based project to train the data and then predict the Employee Retention. Will be using Flask for REST API.

Welcome to the ML End-To-End Project.
In this project we will discuss about the complete Life Cycle of Machine Learning Project like from Requirement Gathering; Solution Design; Code Development; Deployment and its maintenance. 

Note : This is just a Demo project.

# Life Cycle of a Machine Learning Project Development 
## Defining the Task / Requirement / Problem Statement.


## Data Collection
1. What are the sources? 
2. Validate the data and Transform
3. Data Collection Pipeline 

## Model Exploration
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Building

## Model Refinement
1. Cross Validation
2. Hyper Paramater Tuning

## Test and Evaluation
1. Evaluate model on test distribution

## Deploymet
1. Expose model as REST API
2. Through UI

# Maintenance Model
1. Monitor the model
2. Retrain the model if needed.

# Problem Statement
* Build a Model to Predict Employee Retention based on the HR inputs.
* As we know the larger companies has 100's ; 1000's of employees working for them, and taking care of their needs and satifcication of each employee is a challenging task for HR department. It results in then the important and talented employee leave the company without giving any genuine reasons. To overcome this a company "ABC" wants a ML model to predict the retentation of employee within an organization.
* For this they will use the data of previous employee who has worked for the company and by finding the pattern in it predict the retentations in the form of YES or NO.

# Expectation / Final Product Output
* REST API to train the model using training batch data.
* REST API to predict the Result using Prediction batch dataset.
